# Bangla_Text_to_image_gen

# Idea -> Add word embedding in the discriminator or generator loss measurement 

# Should we preserve the aspect ration of the image? 

# ------ Before Training -------
# Check if shuffled data in model.py is (caption and image pair) is correct or not 
# Fix the loss function 
# Shuffle Dataset
# Discriminator / Generator er error ta thik moto implement kora 
# Model er bibhinno component save kora during trainging and load 
# Show image every nth step so that we know how we are progressing 
# log current losses 
# Caption encoding (Check others code)
# Train DAMSM Model 
# Adapt this code for Google colab 

# ------- Testing --------
# Implement function for evaluating the model
